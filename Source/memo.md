### 3rd Library Hack

- Solve the confusing of text line break-up of the default Editor when it blends Chinese charactors and English words:
    - L227 in TextEditor, the 'if' statement need comment `text.isWhitespace() && `
- Increase line-spacing:
    - Same class above, L481 change the original to `lineHeight = section->font.getHeight() + 4;`
	- L540 change the original to `atomX, (float) roundToInt (lineY + lineHeight - maxDescent - 2));`
	- L573 change the original to `atomX, (float) roundToInt (lineY + lineHeight - maxDescent - 2));`
	- L560-561 change to (underline change to backgound highlight):
```
	//g.reduceClipRegion (Rectangle<int> (startX, baselineY, endX - startX, 1));
    //g.fillCheckerBoard (Rectangle<int> (endX, baselineY + 1), 3, 1, colour, Colours::transparentBlack);
    g.setColour (Colours::cyan.withAlpha (0.95f));
    g.fillRoundedRectangle (startX - 1.f, baselineY - lineHeight + 10.5f, endX - startX + 2.f, lineHeight - 2.5f, 5.f);
    drawSelectedText (g, underline, colour);
```
