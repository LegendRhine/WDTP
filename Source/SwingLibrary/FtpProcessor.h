/**	This class uses background thread, can be used for FTP download, upload, delete, 
    move and rename remote file/dir, also can list remote dirs and files. 

    Usage:

    1. Create object, setUserNameAndPassword() for your ftp server, 
       and setRemoteRootDir(). All of the succedent operations will base on this root-dir.
       Then call connectOk () to check out if the connection successful or not.

    2. If everything is OK, call the functions do what you want.

    3. For get the files and dirs list, you may need to call getDirectoryListing().
       This method will return a stringArray (file or dir lists) base on the argument path
       which relative to the root-dir.

    4. Also, you may use FtpProcessor::Listener class handle some needs.

    5. Want a progress value when upload and download file? Just call getProgress() after
       perform a operation.

    Note: to use this class, make sure you have the permission of your server, 
    the normal FTP commands can be performed correctly on this server, 
    and the remote file and dir has the proper attribute that can be deleted, created, renamed or moved.
