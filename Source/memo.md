### 3rd Library Hack

- Solve the confusing of text line break-up of the default Editor when it blends Chinese charactors and English words:
    - L227 in TextEditor, the 'if' statement need comment `text.isWhitespace() && `
- Increase line-spacing:
    - Same class above, L481 change the original to `lineHeight = section->font.getHeight() + 4;`
	- L540 change the original to `atomX, (float) roundToInt (lineY + lineHeight - maxDescent - 2));`
	- L573 change the original to `atomX, (float) roundToInt (lineY + lineHeight - maxDescent - 2));`
